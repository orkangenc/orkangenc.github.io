    <p><strong>With China continuing to roll out pilot trials for its digital Yuan, and the Bank of England exploring the feasibility of a CBDC, the future of currency seems about to take a digital turn. Japan and India are two other major countries looking into this technology. The US has not announced any research on the subject as yet.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">The RBA has partnered with CBA, NAB and ConsenSys in order to develop the project. According to the Australian website&nbsp;</span>

    <p><span data-contrast="auto">The Deputy head of the payments policy department Chris Thompson stated:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p><em><span data-contrast="auto">&ldquo;The project is underway at the moment [and] we're looking to finish it very soon.

        <p><em><span data-contrast="auto">&ldquo;We're very interested in how blockchain can help us in markets where there are lots of inefficiencies," she said.</span></em><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><em><span data-contrast="auto">&ldquo;We wanted to start with a syndicated loan because they're high value, low volume transactions and there are lots of duplicated processes in the ecosystem, lots of errors or potential for errors, and lots of operational risks.</span></em>

        <p><em><span data-contrast="auto">&ldquo;We very much came into this project looking</span></em><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><em><span data-contrast="auto">at the utility of the CBDC from a wholesale point of view, just on those large transactions to remove those errors, save time, and we're very interested in atomic settlement&rdquo;.</span></em>

    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Noises coming out of Australia&rsquo;s central bank are actually quite negative as regards the need for a digital Aussie dollar. The bank has said that &ldquo;cash is still widely available and accepted as a means of payment&rdquo;.</span>

    </p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">However, the bank will &ldquo;continue to consider the case for a CBDC&rdquo;. Wade, who originally started off with a negative view has certainly changed her stance since working on the project. She says that decentralised finance &ldquo;is the future&rdquo;.</span>
